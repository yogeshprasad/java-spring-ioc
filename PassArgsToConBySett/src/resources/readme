By Spring::::

We can pass all the dependency of the classes by xml file using ioc container

DAO CLASSES HAS DEPENDENCY OF :: JDBC DRIVER, DB URL, USERNAME, PASSWORD, CONNECTION POOL  AND ALL

BUSINESS :: DAO, TRANSECTION, SECURITY, MAIL, ETC



 spring.xml              IOC CONTAINER                DAO CLASSES        
 
 JDBC DRIVER,                                      setter method ////  parameterized constructor
 DB URL,                                           should have in the dao classes to receive parameter from the IOC container
 USERNAME,            ------------------>>>
 PASSWORD
 
 
 by default container create the object using default constructor
 
 to call the setter method we uses the property tag. name, value
 to call the constructor we uses the constrator-arg, value, index, type, for primitive or ref for secondary data type
